1. There is a custom dispatcher (redis-dispatcher) that is used inside of the sharded actors
2. When there is only one Akka node it reports the custom dispatcher metrics "redis-dispatcher"
   but once one more Akka node is added, _after some time_ **it stops reporting a custom dispatcher metrics** for some reason.
3. The Scala Future metrics keep being reported correctly ("redis-call")
   
It's setup to report metrics to the console as well as to Prometheus.

Run on the first node:
```
export PROMETHEUS_PORT=9001
sbt "runMain sample.sharding.ShardingApp 2551"
```

Run on the second node:
```
export PROMETHEUS_PORT=9002
sbt "runMain sample.sharding.ShardingApp 2552"
```

Request the Dispatcher metrics with:
```
curl http://localhost:9001/ | grep "redis-dispatcher"
curl http://localhost:9002/ | grep "redis-dispatcher"
```

Request the Scala Future metrics with:
```
curl http://localhost:9001/ | grep "redis-call"
curl http://localhost:9002/ | grep "redis-call"
```
